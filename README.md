# 🥷 Network Ninja

**Educational hacking game where AI learns from you and stories emerge from your actions.**

---

## 🎮 What Is This?

Infiltrate networks, steal data, escape detection. But here's the twist:
- **AI learns your tactics** and adapts defenses
- **Your actions generate news** that affect future missions
- **Real hacking commands** via terminal (or buttons for beginners)
- **Network traffic simulation** with A* pathfinding

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

---

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Scan** network → Discover nodes
2. **Exploit** vulnerabilities → Compromise systems  
3. **Move** laterally → Reach target
4. **Steal** data → Complete objective
5. **Escape** before traced → Win!

**Pro tip:** Type `help` in terminal for expert mode.
